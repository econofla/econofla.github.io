**Summary.** The third quarter of 2025 witnessed a **divergent pricing environment** across wafer segments, with 300mm wafer pricing demonstrating remarkable stability while 200mm markets experienced meaningful tightening driven by specialty node demand. Contract pricing negotiations reflected **stable utilization rates** across leading global suppliers, with capacity constraints continuing to shape market dynamics.

**Context.** The global wafer supply chain remains fundamentally constrained by **extended lead times** in crystal growth operations and polishing capacity limitations. Major suppliers including Shin-Etsu Chemical, SUMCO, and Siltronic continue to operate at **near-maximum utilization rates** of 95-98%, with new capacity additions limited by the 18-24 month lead times required for crystal pulling equipment installation. The industry's **consolidated supplier base** has created structural supply discipline, with the top five suppliers controlling approximately **85% of global 300mm capacity** and **78% of 200mm capacity**.

**Market Data and Pricing Analysis.** The 300mm wafer segment, representing approximately **70% of total wafer revenue**, experienced minimal price movement with contracts showing **flat to +1% quarter-over-quarter** growth. This stability reflects the mature nature of high-volume 300mm production and the **long-term contract structures** that dominate relationships between leading foundries and wafer suppliers. Spot market activity remained limited, accounting for less than **5% of total 300mm volume**, with spot premiums averaging **8-12% above contract pricing**.

The 200mm segment demonstrated more pronounced pricing momentum with **+2-4% quarter-over-quarter** increases across most product categories. This tightening was particularly evident in automotive-grade and industrial-specification wafers, where demand growth of **6-8% year-over-year** has outpaced the industry's modest capacity expansion. **Reclaimed wafer pricing** showed even stronger dynamics, with increases of **4-6% quarter-over-quarter** as supply remained constrained.

Specialty substrate markets, including **Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN)**, exhibited significant pricing dispersion as the market continues to mature. SiC wafer pricing showed **15-25% variance** across suppliers, reflecting differences in crystal quality, defect density specifications, and supply chain reliability. The **150mm SiC market** experienced particular tightness, with lead times extending to **20-26 weeks** for automotive-qualified substrates.


**Outlook.** Base case: modest ASP expansion through next quarter as utilization normalizes.
