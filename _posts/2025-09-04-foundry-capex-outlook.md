**Summary.** Announced foundry capex points to a mixed picture: leading-edge logic nodes continue, while mature-node expansions moderate.

**Key watch items.**
- EUV tool shipments vs. install capacity
- Mature-node debottlenecking (power, water)
- Subsidy-driven projects and milestone timing

**Take.** Expect staggered ramp timing; monitor tool vendors' order books for confirmation.
