**Summary.** Announced foundry capex points to a mixed picture across the semiconductor manufacturing landscape. Leading-edge logic nodes at **3nm and below** continue to attract substantial investment, with TSMC allocating approximately **$32-36 billion** in capital expenditure for 2025, while Samsung maintains a **$25-28 billion** commitment. However, mature-node expansions are showing signs of moderation as demand patterns shift and capacity utilization rates stabilize around **85-90%** for nodes above 28nm.

The current foundry investment cycle reflects a fundamental divergence between cutting-edge process technology development and established manufacturing capabilities. **TSMC's Arizona facilities** represent a **$40 billion** commitment through 2026, focusing on 4nm and 3nm production with initial capacity targets of **20,000 wafers per month** by late 2024. Meanwhile, Intel's foundry services division has earmarked **$20 billion** for Ohio fabrication facilities, targeting **18A and 20A nodes** with production readiness expected by 2025.

**Key watch items** include EUV tool shipments versus actual install capacity, where ASML's delivery schedule indicates **55-60 High-NA EUV systems** planned for 2025 across all customers. Current installation capacity suggests potential bottlenecks, as each High-NA system requires **6-8 months** for complete setup and qualification. The mature-node segment faces infrastructure constraints, particularly regarding **power distribution and water cooling systems**. Facilities operating at nodes between **40nm and 180nm** are experiencing debottlenecking challenges, with power requirements increasing **15-20%** annually due to higher throughput demands.

Subsidy-driven projects across multiple regions are creating additional complexity in timing predictions. The **CHIPS Act allocation** of **$52.7 billion** has triggered numerous domestic expansion announcements, though actual disbursement schedules remain tied to specific milestone achievements. European initiatives under the **EU Chips Act** targeting **43 billion euros** in combined public and private investment are similarly structured around performance-based releases.

**GlobalFoundries** has committed **$3.1 billion** primarily for mature-node capacity expansion in Malta and Singapore, focusing on automotive and IoT applications where demand visibility extends through 2027. UMC's capital allocation of **$1.8 billion** emphasizes specialty processes including **BCD and RFSOI technologies**, responding to power management and RF connectivity requirements.

The equipment vendor landscape provides additional insight into foundry investment patterns. **Applied Materials** reported foundry-related orders representing **65%** of total semiconductor equipment bookings in Q3 2024, while **Lam Research** indicated **40%** growth in foundry segment revenues year-over-year. These figures suggest sustained momentum despite broader industry cyclicality.

**Take.** Expect staggered ramp timing across different technology nodes and geographical regions through 2026. Leading-edge facilities will likely achieve meaningful production volumes by **Q3 2025**, while mature-node expansions face longer lead times due to infrastructure limitations. Monitor tool vendors' order books quarterly for confirmation of sustained momentum, particularly **ASML's EUV delivery schedules** and **KLA's process control equipment** orders, which serve as leading indicators for actual fab readiness. The **18-24 month lag** between equipment orders and production ramp remains a critical factor in capacity planning accuracy.
