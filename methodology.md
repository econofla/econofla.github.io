We follow a consistent framework for every review:
1. **Context**: segment, players, and recent macro signals.
2. **Data**: pricing, capacity, lead times, inventory.
3. **Drivers**: demand (end-markets), supply (fabs/equipment), policy.
4. **Outlook**: base, bull, and bear scenarios.
5. **Risks**: what could break the thesis.

Each post includes sources and, where possible, open data links.
