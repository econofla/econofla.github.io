    <p>The global semiconductor industry is facing one of its most complex challenges in decades. The explosive growth of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> workloads has created a massive surge in demand for advanced silicon, especially GPUs, AI accelerators, and <strong>high bandwidth memory</strong>. This is happening while the supply chain remains rigid and expansion takes years.</p>

<p>AI adoption requires unprecedented compute power. Training a single frontier model can require tens of thousands of GPUs, and inference workloads scale even further as models are deployed to millions of users. This puts immense pressure on foundries, wafer suppliers, and equipment makers. Lead times are long, utilization rates are above <strong>95%</strong>, and critical inputs like EUV tools face their own shortages.</p>

<p>Industry data shows how strained the system is. GPU lead times exceed twelve months. HBM3 prices are up more than <strong>20% year on year</strong>, with expectations of further increases. Foundry capex is rising, but new fabs take 18 to 24 months to build. Geopolitical restrictions limit access to advanced chips in some regions, further tightening global supply.</p>

<p>The key drivers of the shortage are clear. Hyperscalers treat compute as a strategic moat and will pay almost any price for advanced silicon. At the same time, <strong>electric vehicles</strong>, renewable energy, and industrial automation compete for many of the same resources. The supply chain is slow to adapt, as fabrication is capital intensive and dependent on a few suppliers. Policy efforts like the US CHIPS Act and the EU Chips Act are underway, but construction is only beginning.</p>

<p>The economic consequences ripple outward. Upstream suppliers and tool vendors have strong pricing power. Downstream industries such as AI startups struggle to secure compute and must partner with hyperscalers. Asia continues to dominate manufacturing, while the US and EU aim to localize production but will not see major capacity shifts until 2026 or later. Investors see equipment makers as winners, while downstream buyers face margin pressure.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, the <strong>base case</strong> is that shortages persist into 2026. Prices for GPUs and memory remain high, and new capacity eases constraints only gradually. A <strong>bull case</strong> would see breakthroughs in packaging or accelerated fab timelines. A <strong>bear case</strong> could arise from geopolitical shocks such as Taiwan Strait tensions, which would deepen shortages and stall AI adoption globally.</p>

<p>There are also risks to monitor. Fab construction could be delayed, energy and water supplies may constrain operations, and supply remains concentrated in East Asia. There is also the possibility of <strong>overbuilding</strong> if demand projections prove too optimistic.</p>

<p>The silicon economy is now a critical axis of global competition. Compute has become a <strong>geopolitical and economic resource</strong>, and the current shortages reveal the fragility of the system. In the medium term, the challenge will be not only to produce enough chips but to do so in a way that is <strong>resilient, diversified, and sustainable</strong>.</p>
