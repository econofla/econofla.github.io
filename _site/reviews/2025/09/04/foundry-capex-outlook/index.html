    <p><strong>Summary.</strong> Announced foundry capex points to a mixed picture across the semiconductor manufacturing landscape. Leading-edge logic nodes at <strong>3nm and below</strong> continue to attract substantial investment, with TSMC allocating approximately <strong>$32-36 billion</strong> in capital expenditure for 2025, while Samsung maintains a <strong>$25-28 billion</strong> commitment. However, mature-node expansions are showing signs of moderation as demand patterns shift and capacity utilization rates stabilize around <strong>85-90%</strong> for nodes above 28nm.</p>

<p>The current foundry investment cycle reflects a fundamental divergence between cutting-edge process technology development and established manufacturing capabilities. <strong>TSMC’s Arizona facilities</strong> represent a <strong>$40 billion</strong> commitment through 2026, focusing on 4nm and 3nm production with initial capacity targets of <strong>20,000 wafers per month</strong> by late 2024. Meanwhile, Intel’s foundry services division has earmarked <strong>$20 billion</strong> for Ohio fabrication facilities, targeting <strong>18A and 20A nodes</strong> with production readiness expected by 2025.</p>

<p><strong>Key watch items</strong> include EUV tool shipments versus actual install capacity, where ASML’s delivery schedule indicates <strong>55-60 High-NA EUV systems</strong> planned for 2025 across all customers. Current installation capacity suggests potential bottlenecks, as each High-NA system requires <strong>6-8 months</strong> for complete setup and qualification. The mature-node segment faces infrastructure constraints, particularly regarding <strong>power distribution and water cooling systems</strong>. Facilities operating at nodes between <strong>40nm and 180nm</strong> are experiencing debottlenecking challenges, with power requirements increasing <strong>15-20%</strong> annually due to higher throughput demands.</p>

<p>Subsidy-driven projects across multiple regions are creating additional complexity in timing predictions. The <strong>CHIPS Act allocation</strong> of <strong>$52.7 billion</strong> has triggered numerous domestic expansion announcements, though actual disbursement schedules remain tied to specific milestone achievements. European initiatives under the <strong>EU Chips Act</strong> targeting <strong>43 billion euros</strong> in combined public and private investment are similarly structured around performance-based releases.</p>

<p><strong>GlobalFoundries</strong> has committed <strong>$3.1 billion</strong> primarily for mature-node capacity expansion in Malta and Singapore, focusing on automotive and IoT applications where demand visibility extends through 2027. UMC’s capital allocation of <strong>$1.8 billion</strong> emphasizes specialty processes including <strong>BCD and RFSOI technologies</strong>, responding to power management and RF connectivity requirements.</p>

<p>The equipment vendor landscape provides additional insight into foundry investment patterns. <strong>Applied Materials</strong> reported foundry-related orders representing <strong>65%</strong> of total semiconductor equipment bookings in Q3 2024, while <strong>Lam Research</strong> indicated <strong>40%</strong> growth in foundry segment revenues year-over-year. These figures suggest sustained momentum despite broader industry cyclicality.</p>

<p><strong>Take.</strong> Expect staggered ramp timing across different technology nodes and geographical regions through 2026. Leading-edge facilities will likely achieve meaningful production volumes by <strong>Q3 2025</strong>, while mature-node expansions face longer lead times due to infrastructure limitations. Monitor tool vendors’ order books quarterly for confirmation of sustained momentum, particularly <strong>ASML’s EUV delivery schedules</strong> and <strong>KLA’s process control equipment</strong> orders, which serve as leading indicators for actual fab readiness. The <strong>18-24 month lag</strong> between equipment orders and production ramp remains a critical factor in capacity planning accuracy.</p>
