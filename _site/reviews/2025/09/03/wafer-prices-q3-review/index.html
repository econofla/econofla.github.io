    <p><strong>Summary.</strong> The third quarter of 2025 witnessed a <strong>divergent pricing environment</strong> across wafer segments, with 300mm wafer pricing demonstrating remarkable stability while 200mm markets experienced meaningful tightening driven by specialty node demand. Contract pricing negotiations reflected <strong>stable utilization rates</strong> across leading global suppliers, with capacity constraints continuing to shape market dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Context.</strong> The global wafer supply chain remains fundamentally constrained by <strong>extended lead times</strong> in crystal growth operations and polishing capacity limitations. Major suppliers including Shin-Etsu Chemical, SUMCO, and Siltronic continue to operate at <strong>near-maximum utilization rates</strong> of 95-98%, with new capacity additions limited by the 18-24 month lead times required for crystal pulling equipment installation. The industry’s <strong>consolidated supplier base</strong> has created structural supply discipline, with the top five suppliers controlling approximately <strong>85% of global 300mm capacity</strong> and <strong>78% of 200mm capacity</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Market Data and Pricing Analysis.</strong> The 300mm wafer segment, representing approximately <strong>70% of total wafer revenue</strong>, experienced minimal price movement with contracts showing <strong>flat to +1% quarter-over-quarter</strong> growth. This stability reflects the mature nature of high-volume 300mm production and the <strong>long-term contract structures</strong> that dominate relationships between leading foundries and wafer suppliers. Spot market activity remained limited, accounting for less than <strong>5% of total 300mm volume</strong>, with spot premiums averaging <strong>8-12% above contract pricing</strong>.</p>

<p>The 200mm segment demonstrated more pronounced pricing momentum with <strong>+2-4% quarter-over-quarter</strong> increases across most product categories. This tightening was particularly evident in automotive-grade and industrial-specification wafers, where demand growth of <strong>6-8% year-over-year</strong> has outpaced the industry’s modest capacity expansion. <strong>Reclaimed wafer pricing</strong> showed even stronger dynamics, with increases of <strong>4-6% quarter-over-quarter</strong> as supply remained constrained.</p>

<p>Specialty substrate markets, including <strong>Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Gallium Nitride (GaN)</strong>, exhibited significant pricing dispersion as the market continues to mature. SiC wafer pricing showed <strong>15-25% variance</strong> across suppliers, reflecting differences in crystal quality, defect density specifications, and supply chain reliability. The <strong>150mm SiC market</strong> experienced particular tightness, with lead times extending to <strong>20-26 weeks</strong> for automotive-qualified substrates.</p>

<p><strong>Outlook.</strong> Base case: modest ASP expansion through next quarter as utilization normalizes.</p>
